# lightlang
A simple experiment language written in 2 days in golang.
I thought it'd be nice to make something like luau typescript python and other languages in golang so i decided to make this,
the 2 days thing is a lie there were earlier versions of this project that are terrible and cant even run anything unlike this one. This is the best iteration of this project yet.
